PennApp2013
===========

A Hahckthon project created during PennApp2013, Winter.

The project was aimed for non-technical people looking for hosting needs for their media contents such as images, videos, and audios.

It uses Dropbox API to pull contents from the users, and Facebook API to track the visitors on top of many other software frame works and tools.
